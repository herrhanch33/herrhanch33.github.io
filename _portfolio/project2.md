The project was based on Python using Django, Anaconda, Sklearn, and Kaggle. 
We used Machine learned AI Model to predict prices of houses in Jakarta using numbers of bathrooms and bedrooms, districts, and certificates.
We worked on front end, back end, and AI Model to develop our MVT-based project.
